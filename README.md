# Kanye Says...

This Python code uses the `tkinter` and `requests` libraries to create a GUI that displays a random quote from Kanye West's API.

## Usage

To use this script, you'll need to run the code in a Python environment and make sure the following files are in the same directory as the script:

- `background.png`
- `kanye.png`

When you run the script, a window will open with a background image and a button that displays a random quote from Kanye's API when clicked.

## Dependencies

This script requires the `tkinter` and `requests` libraries to run. You can install them using `pip`:

```
pip install tkinter
pip install requests
```
